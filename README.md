## Mint professional-looking NFTs 

The WAX NFT metadata standards are a collection of fields to use when creating your schema on Atomic Assets. We provide copy-paste, plug-and-play schemas that work with the most popular markets on both US and WAX, starting with [Atomichub](https://wax.atomichub.io/), [NFThive](https://nfthive.com/), [WAXdao](https://waxdao.com/) and more. 


# Learn how to use these in the [Instructional Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXjBQnV_Xm8) made for our similar [Music NFT standard](https://github.com/currentxchange/Music-NFT-Standard). 

# The Standards

Each standard uses these basic fields, and expands to a type-specific list of fields. 

The individual standards are linked farther down, and exist in the [./Standards](./Standards) directory.

`string` just means text, `ipfs` is an [ipfs hash](https://www.pinata.cloud/) of the data.

| Field | Type | Description | 
| :----:  | :----: | :---- |
| name | string | NFT name |  
| img | ipfs | Primary image, because this is an IPFS field, you can use a video here as well, under 7mb weight recommended |  
| artist | string | The artist, for multiple creators see the credits field | 
| title | string | The title of the work | 
| about | string | Description field with main info about the work |  
| backimg | ipfs | Back of the art/book, or used as supplementary artwork |  
| collectionimg | ipfs | Extra image for Collection, optional |  
|<hr>|<hr>|<hr>|
| genre | string | Genre of the work |  
| mood | string | Mood of the work |  
| format | string | Main medium and/or format of the work. This may be used to declare a type/category like "short story" for literature |  
| mood | string | A comma-separated list of categories |  
|<hr>|<hr>|<hr>|
| credits | string | List creator credits, suggested format "Script: Gudasol, Director: Pixy the Unicorn"  |  
| link | string | A link where the work can be purchased or interacted with |  
| license | string | Declare license (Copyright [Year], CC0, MIT, etc) |  
| tags | string | Topics related to the NFT as a comma-separated list |  
| rarity | string | How scarce is this NFT? Abundant Common Uncommon Rare Epic Mythic Unique |  


# Web 4 Options
Web4 adds **space** and **time** information on top of web3. You'll find timespace + light options for each available for each standard: 

## Full timespace options 
| Field | Type | Description | 
| :----:  | :----: | :---- |
| timestamp  | int64 | Timestamp for the publication of the work (simplifies + supercedes date) |
| date | string | Date when the work was published (supercedes / replaces Year/Month/Day) Recommended format is ISO 8601 "YYYY-MM-DD" because "MM-DD-YYYY" can be confused with "DD/MM/YYYY" but it's up to you. To cover all bases, set timestamp field as a backup, or use year/month/day |
| year       | int64 | Year when the work was published. Format: "YYYY". ‚ö†Ô∏è It's best to use either date or year/month/day, not both. |
| month      | string | Month when the work was published. Format: "MM" or English abbreviation (e.g., "Jan", "Feb", etc.) or full month name |
| day        | int64 | Day when the work was published. Format: "DD" or "D" |
|<hr>|<hr>|<hr>|
| location   | string | Full location information in one field, format: "City, State, Nation"  ‚ö†Ô∏è Use this or nation/state/city, not both |
| nation     | string | Three-letter ISO country code (e.g., "USA", "BRA", "AUS", etc.) Please don't use anything else, as this is the easiest format for any application to integrate |
| state      | string | State or province for the location, format: Abbreviation convention used in nation (e.g., California as "CA", Antioquia as "ANT") |
| city       | string | City for the location, format: "City Name" |
| geotag     | string | TopoJSON Point stored as string, format "lat,lng" (e.g., "37.7749,-122.4194"), or a "[lat,lng]" coordinate array (e.g.,  "[37.7749, -122.4194]") |  

> You may inpmement all options to allow templates of he same schema to choose what's best for them, instead of modifying it and keeping it for future unknown templates. 

## Implementation Options

You'll find code blocks for the various NFT Standards. 

You can either copy/paste them, as shown in the [Instructional Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXjBQnV_Xm8) or simply create a new schema on [Atomichub.io](https://wax.atomichub.io/) and type in each field you would like to implement. 

For **detailed instructions** on how to use, see this [article](https://medium.com/p/5b3f951bff05). 


### RAM Usage
While you may see more fields than you'd like to implement in your final NFT, it's okay to use them for the schema. This will make the [RAM requirement](https://anyobservation.medium.com/basic-wax-account-management-d956d74ff103) of schema creation slightly larger, but you'll only be charged for the fields you use when creating templates + NFTs.

# üõ† WAX NFT Metadata Standard
For specific use cases, use these versions:
[./Standards](./Standards/literature.md) 

| Use Case | Link | 
| :----:  | :---- | 
| Literature | [Standards/literature.md](./Standards/literature.md) |
| Video | [Standards/video.md](./Standards/video.md) |
| Image | [Standards/image.md](./Standards/image.md) |
| Photo | [Standards/photo.md](./Standards/photo.md) |
| Music | [Standards/photo.md](./Standards/music.md) |
| Original Music Standard | [currentxchange/Music-NFT-Standard](https://github.com/currentxchange/Music-NFT-Standard) |

> Works with Atomichub UI out of the box. You can even avoid touching this code by using Create Schema on atomichub to replicate.
